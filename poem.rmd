Let me not to the marriage of true minds  
 Admit impediments; love is not love  
 Which alters when it alteration finds,  
 Or bends with the remover to remove:  
 O, no, it is an ever-fixèd mark,  
 That looks on tempests and is never shaken;  
 It is the star to every wand’ring bark,  
 Whose worth’s unknown, although his heighth be taken.  
 Love’s not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks  
 Within his bending sickle’s compass come;  
 Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,  
 But bears it out even to the edge of doom.  
 If this be error and upon me proved,  
 I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
